# OCR-APP
OCR (Optical Character Recognition) App using ColPali implementation of the new Byaldi library + Huggingface transformers for Qwen2-VL.
Made By Prasoon Sharma

This project is an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) app built using Gradio and powered by deep learning models such as Qwen2-VL. The app allows users to upload an image, extract text in both Hindi and English, and optionally highlight keywords in the extracted text.

## Features
- Upload an image and extract text in multiple languages (supports Hindi and English).
- Optional keyword search: Highlights specific keywords in the extracted text.
- Uses OpenCV for image preprocessing.
- Intuitive web-based UI with Gradio for easy interaction.
## Setup
### Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- Gradio
- Transformers (Hugging Face)


Install dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## How to run the app
- Run the [Gradio](https://huggingface.co/spaces/profchaos/OCR-APP) app on Huggingface
- Run on [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lNLVl8FzVRrSv4dMd9vXqnz8SYtKoebf?usp=sharing)
- Run the [Python file](OCR_App.py) locally
